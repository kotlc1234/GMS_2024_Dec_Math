# GMS 2024 Math Problem

## Purpose ##
The purpose of this repository is to try and code a solution to a math problem posed in class in December, 2024.

The problem is as follows:

$$ a/b = c/de = fg/hi $$

where a .. i are different numbers between 1-9 with no number used more than once.

## Goal ##

We will try to write a python program that attempts to solve this equation, but we don't know how!

We used the cross product rule to test if:

$$ a * de = b * c $$
and
$$ c * hi = de * fg $$

Both of these must be true.
